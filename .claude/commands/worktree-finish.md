Clean up a feature worktree after merging.

This command will:
1. Remove the worktree directory
2. Delete the feature branch

Execute the following commands in order:

First, remove the worktree (note: fixing the typo in the path):
```bash
git worktree remove ../rs_pa_worktrees/$ARGUMENTS
```

Then, delete the feature branch:
```bash
git branch -d $ARGUMENTS
```

After running the commands:
- Confirm that the worktree at `../rs_pa_worktrees/$ARGUMENTS` has been removed
- Confirm that the branch `$ARGUMENTS` has been deleted
- If the branch deletion fails (e.g., because it hasn't been merged), inform the user and suggest using `-D` flag if they're sure they want to force delete
