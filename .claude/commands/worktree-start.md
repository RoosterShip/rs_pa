Create a new git worktree for feature development.

This command will:
1. Create a new worktree in the ../rs_pa_worktrees directory

```

After running the command, inform the user that:

- They can navigate to it to start working on the feature
- The new branch `$ARGUMENTS` has been created and checked out in the worktree
