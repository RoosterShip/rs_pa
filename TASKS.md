# Implementation Tasks for RS Personal Assistant

## üéØ Project Overview

This document outlines all implementation tasks required to build the RS Personal Assistant system using an **iterative UI-first development strategy**. Rather than building large chunks at once, each phase delivers a working application with incrementally added features.

## üîÑ Iterative Development Strategy

**Core Philosophy**: Build pieces at a time with immediate visual feedback at each step:
1. **UI First**: Create visible interface elements that users can interact with
2. **Framework Second**: Add the underlying framework code to support the UI
3. **Agent Integration Last**: Connect real AI agents when the foundation is solid

This approach ensures:
- ‚úÖ Progress is visible at every step  
- ‚úÖ Changes can be made without major redesign
- ‚úÖ Working application is maintained throughout development
- ‚úÖ Testing and validation happen continuously

## üìã Task Categories

- **P0**: Critical path items required for MVP
- **P1**: Important features for full functionality  
- **P2**: Nice-to-have enhancements
- **P3**: Future improvements
