# Implementation Tasks for RS Personal Agent

## üéØ Project Overview

This document outlines all implementation tasks required to build the RS Personal Agent as a **native desktop application using PySide6**. The system uses an **iterative UI-first development strategy** where each phase delivers a working desktop application with incrementally added features.

## üîÑ Iterative Development Strategy

**Core Philosophy**: Build pieces at a time with immediate visual feedback at each step:
1. **Native UI First**: Create visible desktop interface elements that users can interact with
2. **Framework Second**: Add the underlying framework code to support the UI components
3. **Agent Integration Last**: Connect real AI agents when the foundation is solid

This approach ensures:
- ‚úÖ Progress is visible at every step with a working desktop app
- ‚úÖ Changes can be made without major redesign 
- ‚úÖ Native desktop application is maintained throughout development
- ‚úÖ Testing and validation happen continuously with real UI interaction

## üìã Task Categories

- **P0**: Critical path items required for MVP
- **P1**: Important features for full functionality  
- **P2**: Nice-to-have enhancements
- **P3**: Future improvements
