# Implementation Tasks for RS Personal Agent

## üéØ Project Overview

This document outlines all implementation tasks required to build the RS Personal Agent as a **native desktop application using PySide6**. The system uses an **iterative UI-first development strategy** where each phase delivers a working desktop application with incrementally added features.

## üîÑ Iterative Development Strategy

**Core Philosophy**: Build pieces at a time with immediate visual feedback at each step:
1. **Native UI First**: Create visible desktop interface elements that users can interact with
2. **Framework Second**: Add the underlying framework code to support the UI components
3. **Agent Integration Last**: Connect real AI agents when the foundation is solid

This approach ensures:
- ‚úÖ Progress is visible at every step with a working desktop app
- ‚úÖ Changes can be made without major redesign 
- ‚úÖ Native desktop application is maintained throughout development
- ‚úÖ Testing and validation happen continuously with real UI interaction

## üìã Task Categories

- **P0**: Critical path items required for MVP
- **P1**: Important features for full functionality  
- **P2**: Nice-to-have enhancements
- **P3**: Future improvements

- [ ] Test alternative deployment methods across platforms

**Result**: Multiple professional deployment options with native desktop as the primary recommended method.

**Files to Create**:
- `Dockerfile` (Optimized for headless/server deployment)
- `docker-compose.yml` (Development environment)
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` (Production server deployment)
- `.dockerignore` (Docker build optimization)

This comprehensive task breakdown provides a clear roadmap for implementing the RS Personal Agent as a **professional native desktop application using PySide6**, with each task having specific acceptance criteria and deliverables focused on Qt-based desktop development.

## üñ•Ô∏è Native Desktop Focus

This task plan has been specifically designed for **native desktop application development** using:
- **PySide6 6.9.1** for Qt6-based native UI
- **MVC architecture** with Qt Model-View patterns
- **Cross-platform desktop deployment** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Professional desktop UX** with system tray, native theming, and keyboard shortcuts
- **PyInstaller + Nuitka** for optimized standalone executables

The entire development strategy prioritizes native desktop user experience over web-based interfaces, ensuring the final application feels like a proper desktop application with full OS integration.
